There a 3 tasks run in this project:

1. We create a Hadoop Cluster using the Docker Console that
consists of 1 master node and 4 clients.

2. We run the word count example provided at *[1]*. This is present in WordCount.java

3. We run a modified word count to find number of bigrams in the input files. This is present in BigramCount.java

For tasks 2 & 3, we use the files file01 & file02 under the directory io in this project
Tasks 2 & 3 are run using a shell script (tasks.sh) inside of the master container

The entire process is automated, and to run all 3 tasks all you need to do is run the shell script runtasks.sh

In other words, in your console type :

    runtasks.sh

NOTE: You will be prompted for your password as there are sudo commands inside this script - please oblige
